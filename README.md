## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation** – Data and behavior are bundled inside classes  
- **Composition** – Library contains Book and Member objects  
- **Modular Design** – Each class is placed in a separate Python module  
- **Abstraction** – Users interact with the system through high-level methods
